Problem 1
=========


   If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
   we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Problem 2
=========


   Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
   previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

                     1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
   exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
